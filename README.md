# [emulair.com]()

## Details
The web version of Emulair is a website created for users and developers so they can keep up with important news about our projects, find tutorials for how to use Emulair, read relevant documentation for how to contribute code and, in the future, run lightweight versions of some popular emulators directly from their web browsers. For more information about the project (such as how the code functions, why the project exists, who worked on it, etc.), check the [Wiki page](https://github.com/Emulair/Emulair-Web/wiki). To see our backlog, check the [Projects page](https://github.com/orgs/Emulair/projects/2).
